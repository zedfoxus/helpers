ng-app is a directive. Takes DOM ownership and acts only on that block

ng-model is also a directive and binds the value of input field to variable name

ng-bind is also a directive. It binds variable to view. Can use {{ <info here> }} instead of ng-bind

ng-init initializes variable with ng-app. There are better alternatives than this to load variables

ng-controller directive defines the controller

MODULES define Angular JS application
CONTROLLERS control the application

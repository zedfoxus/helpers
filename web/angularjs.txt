ng-app takes DOM ownership and acts only on that block
angular.module(...) creates an application that ng-app relates to

ng-model binds the value of input field to variable name

ng-bind is also a directive. It binds variable to view. Can use {{ <info here> }} instead of ng-bind

ng-init initializes variable with ng-app. There are better alternatives than this to load variables

ng-controller directive defines the controller

ng-repeat is like a for loop

MODULES define Angular JS application
CONTROLLERS control the application
